## Welcome to Open Study College's CMS


!! Deployed at https://open-study-college-cms.herokuapp.com/ !!

This content management system offers a UI to manipulate the Open Study college's API and database

Ideally, through this CMS you could create, read, update and delete any data in the database. However, due to time concerns, full functionality is only available for <code> /courses </code> currently.

ðŸš€ <code>/courses</code> offers an example of a completed  CMS UI that would eventually be applied to <code>/users</code> , <code>/carts</code> .
